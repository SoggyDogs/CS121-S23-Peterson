| P1 | [ArrayLists and Jumps](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/Activity%2017%20ArrayLists%20and%20Jumps)  | CS121 Program that demonstrates the use of ArrayLists using two examples, the first example requests user input for a course name, gpa, score, and letter grade. The program loops until the user enters q and then prints the results. The second example demonstates ArrayLists using Strings by adding student scores to the ArrayList then it prints the size of the scres list as well as the scores using a for each loop and a for loop then removing one score and printing again with a for each loop. Lastly the score at index 1 is printed|
