| Number | Item | Description |
| :----: | ---- | --------- |
| P1 | [ArrayLists and Jumps](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/Activity%2017%20ArrayLists%20and%20Jumps)  | CS121 Program that demonstrates the use of ArrayLists using two examples, the first example requests user input for a course name, gpa, score, and letter grade. The program loops until the user enters q and then prints the results. The second example demonstates ArrayLists using Strings by adding student scores to the ArrayList then it prints the size of the scres list as well as the scores using a for each loop and a for loop then removing one score and printing again with a for each loop. Lastly the score at index 1 is printed|
| P2 | [Binary Search Activity](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/Activity%2027%20Binary%20Search%20Activity) | CS121 Program that demonstrates the use of Binary Search by adding values to an ArrayList unsorted. The program will print the unsorted list to the console then it will sort and print the sorted list as well. Next it will prompt the user to enter a number to search for in the list. Once entered the program will print each comparison displaying where each low, mid, and high index is located in the ArrayList. |
| P3 | [Queues Activity](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/Activity%2033%20Queues) | CS121 Program that demonstrates the use of Queues by printing ten different tests. The tests enqueue new string values into the queue, removes values from the queue, prints a boolean value if the queue is empty or not, prints the number of items in the queue, and lastly prints where the head of the queue is at any given time. |
| P4 | [Files Read and Write Activity](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/Files%20Read%20and%20Write) | CS121 Program that demonstrates the use of FileWriter and PrintWriter by showing examples in three classes. In the first class the program writes the user entered course name, course credits, and course score to the mycourses.txt file included in the activity. The second class prints what is written in the courses.txt file to the console. The third class requests three of each course, credits, and score and writes them to the mycourses.txt file included. |
| P5 | [HashMaps Activity](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/HashMaps) | CS121 Program that demonstrates the use of HashMaps with two examples. The first example puts values on the new HashMap as countries and their capitals, it them prints them to the console. The first example also prints the size of the HashMap, boolean values if certain values are included, and printing just the capital of a country. The second example adds courses and scores to a GradesList HashMap and prints the course and score to the console, it also prints an individual courses score and removes that course, then printing that the removed course was not found. |
| P6 | [Project 2](https://github.com/SoggyDogs/CS121-S23-Peterson/tree/main/Project2) | CS121 Program that has a Pokemon class that contains instance variables such as name, hitPoints, move, movePower, and attackSpeed. The program also includes a PokemonSelection class that prompts two players to enter their pokemons stats going through the instance variables one by one until each player has selected their pokemon. Then the program prints each Players Pokemon to the console. |
